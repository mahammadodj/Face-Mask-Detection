# Mask Wear Detector
## Overview

COVID-19 mask detector could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the
safety of others.
Approach: A simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine
Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. This method
detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not.

The goal of this project is to build a robust solution that should detect and identify the person is
wearing mask or not. With a varying distance and color combination, it should work for
any person.

Overall, 1143 images for training and 286 images for validation were used. Transfer Learning (InceptionV3) is used in this project to get the best results with limited the dataset.
## Project Goal
This complete poject is made as a part of Data Science Internship at [iNeuron.ai](https://internship.ineuron.ai/).
